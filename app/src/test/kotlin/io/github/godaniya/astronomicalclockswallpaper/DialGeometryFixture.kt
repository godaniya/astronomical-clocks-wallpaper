 * Independent reference angles generated 2026-09-30 with pyerfa 2.0.1.5 (ERFA 2.0.1,
 * SOFA 20231011), Python 3.13.15. The Sun longitude column was added 2026-10-04 with the
 * same pyerfa 2.0.1.5 release under Python 3.11.16. ERFA is derived from SOFA; no Astronomy
 * Engine result or formula was used to generate any of these values. All angles are degrees.

 * Reproduce each timestamp's calendar fields (y, m, d, hh, mm, ss) in Python:
 *   import erfa, math
 *   utc = erfa.dtf2d("UTC", y, m, d, hh, mm, ss)
 *   ut1 = erfa.utcut1(*utc, 0.0)
 *   tt = erfa.taitt(*erfa.utctai(*utc))
 *   gast = math.degrees(erfa.gst06a(*ut1, *tt))
 *   obliquity = math.degrees(erfa.obl06(*tt) + erfa.nut06a(*tt)[1])
 *
 * GAST uses IAU 2006 precession and IAU 2000A nutation. True obliquity is IAU 2006
 * mean obliquity plus the nutation in obliquity. There is no refraction. Longitude is
 * east-positive; local apparent sidereal angle is (GAST + longitude) modulo 360.
 * UT1-UTC is explicitly zero, matching the engine's rotation approximation rather than
 * measured Earth orientation. UTC-to-TT uses the leap-second table: TT-UTC = 69.184 s
 * for these dates. The engine instead predicts Delta-T around 75.05-75.65 s here and
 * truncates its nutation series to five terms. The tests allow these model differences:
 * 0.0001 degree (0.36 arcsecond) in sidereal angle and 0.00003 degree (0.108 arcsecond)
 * in obliquity. These are comparison tolerances, not claimed accuracy against measured
 * UT1: ignoring DUT1 can itself cost up to about 13.5 arcseconds of rotation.
 *
 * sunLongitudeDeg reproduces the same quantity the engine's `sunPosition` returns, and
 * mirrors that function step for step rather than using the nearest ERFA routine:
 *   import erfa, math
 *   import numpy as np
 *   LIGHT_TIME_DAYS = 0.005775518331089121   # 1 / 173.1446326846693 AU/day (C_AUDAY)
 *   retarded = (tt[0], tt[1] - LIGHT_TIME_DAYS)
 *   pvh, pvb = erfa.epv00(*retarded)          # ICRS heliocentric Earth
 *   sun_icrs = -np.asarray(pvh[0])            # geocentric Sun
 *   eqd = erfa.pnm06a(*retarded) @ sun_icrs   # true equator and equinox of date
 *   eps = erfa.obl06(*retarded) + erfa.nut06a(*retarded)[1]
 *   ey = eqd[1]*math.cos(eps) + eqd[2]*math.sin(eps)
 *   lon = math.degrees(math.atan2(ey, eqd[0])) % 360.0
 *
 * Two choices in that recipe matter. `ecm06` is deliberately not used: it is the *mean*
 * ecliptic and equinox of date, so it drops the nutation in longitude, which the engine
 * includes. And the obliquity is evaluated at the light-time-retarded instant, because
 * `sunPosition` calls `earthTilt(adjustedTime)`; the trueObliquityDeg column above instead
 * uses the unretarded instant, so the two columns rest on marginally different epochs.
 * The frame is the *geometric* ecliptic longitude in the true ecliptic and equinox of date:
 * light-time retardation, precession, and nutation are applied, and annual aberration and
 * gravitational light deflection are not. Calling it "apparent" would overclaim by the
 * constant of aberration, about 20.49 arcseconds.
 *
 * Tolerance is set from evidence. Against the pinned engine the largest residual over the
 * seven instants is 0.000434 degree (1.56 arcsecond), on 2026-06-21T00:00:00Z, consistent
 * with the engine's five-term nutation truncation and its modeled Delta-T. The tolerance is
 * 0.001 degree (3.6 arcseconds), about 2.3 times that residual and far below both the 20.49
 * arcsecond annual aberration and the 17.2 arcsecond nutation amplitude, so a frame error, a
 * dropped nutation term, or a wrongly applied aberration term still fails the comparison.
 *
 * Second, independent source. JPL Horizons (DE441), geocentric observer, target Sun,
 * 2026-06-21T00:00:00Z, quantity 31 gives ObsEcLon = 89.6655938 degrees, against this
 * fixture's 89.6656977: a difference of 0.0001040 degree (0.374 arcsecond). Two independent
 * ephemerides and precession-nutation theories agreeing to well under an arcsecond is
 * enough to identify the terms the value does *not* contain: applying the annual-aberration
 * term to the ERFA vector moves it 0.0057 degree (20.5 arcseconds), and rotating to the mean
 * equinox of date moves it 0.0022 degree (7.8 arcseconds, the nutation in longitude), both
 * far outside the residual. Horizons' geocentric Sun place therefore excludes annual
 * aberration at this instant too, which is the second, independent confirmation that the
 * value is geometric and not apparent. The residual itself is not attributed to a single
 * term here. Query: CENTER='500@399', QUANTITIES='31', START_TIME='2026-06-21 00:00',
 * STEP_SIZE='1 m'. Its topocentric counterpart (CENTER='coord@399',
 * SITE_COORD='14.42,50.0,0') gives 89.6659068, 0.75 arcsecond away, which is solar parallax.
 *
 * The rows cover all four 2026 seasons plus adjacent instants across a UTC date boundary.
 * Times label evaluation instants; they do not claim to be exact equinox/solstice events.
 *
 * moonLongitudeDeg and moonPhaseLongitudeDeg were added 2026-10-04 with the same pyerfa
 * 2.0.1.5 release. moonLongitudeDeg reproduces the quantity the engine's `eclipticGeoMoon`
 * returns: the Moon's geocentric ecliptic longitude in the true ecliptic and equinox of date.
 * ERFA has no lunar ephemeris of its own, so the position comes from `eraMoon98`, which ERFA
 * documents as a full implementation of Meeus's algorithm except that the light-time
 * correction to the Moon's mean longitude is omitted, and warns is "not IAU-endorsed and
 * without canonical status". The reduction to the true ecliptic of date is then the same as
 * the Sun column's, and `tt` is the argument throughout because `moon98` takes TT:
 *   moon = erfa.moon98(*tt)[0]                  # GCRS position, au
 *   eqd = erfa.pnm06a(*tt) @ moon
 *   eps = erfa.obl06(*tt) + erfa.nut06a(*tt)[1]
 *   lon = math.degrees(math.atan2(eqd[1]*math.cos(eps) + eqd[2]*math.sin(eps), eqd[0])) % 360.0
 *
 * moonPhaseLongitudeDeg is that column reduced against the Sun column above:
 * (moonLongitudeDeg - sunLongitudeDeg) % 360, which is the engine's `moonPhase` definition,
 * the Moon's ecliptic longitude less the Sun's, 0 at new and 180 at full. Both are geometric
 * and geocentric: no aberration, no refraction, and no lunar parallax, which reaches about
 * one degree and is the largest single term these columns leave out.
 *
 * Residuals measured against the pinned engine over these seven instants: moonLongitudeDeg
 * within 0.0016397 degree (5.90 arcsecond) and moonPhaseLongitudeDeg within 0.0061575 degree
 * (22.17 arcsecond). Both are far larger than the Sun column's, and the tolerances in
 * DialGeometryTest are set from them rather than from the Sun's. Two effects drive the Moon's
 * larger residual, and both are model differences rather than defects: the two sides use
 * independent lunar theories — the engine's Brown-derived Improved Lunar Ephemeris of 1954 by
 * way of Montenbruck and Pfleger, against Meeus's truncated series in `eraMoon98`, whose own
 * documented RMS error against ELP/MPP02 is 2.9 arcsecond and whose worst case is 18.3 — and
 * the engine predicts Delta-T where this recipe uses the leap-second table, about 6 seconds of
 * TT and so about 3.3 arcsecond of lunar motion. The phase column carries one more
 * near-constant offset: the engine's `moonPhase` is not its own `eclipticGeoMoon().lon` less
 * its own `sunPosition().elon`. Measured over these instants that difference runs from -19.85
 * to -21.18 arcsecond, and its cause was not isolated here.
 *
 * Second, independent source. JPL Horizons (DE441), geocentric observer, target Moon (301),
 * quantity 31 gives ObsEcLon at each instant that falls on its one-minute step grid, against
 * this fixture's column (difference in arcsecond):
 *   2026-01-01T00:00:00Z   66.7156363   -4.47
 *   2026-03-20T14:46:00Z   20.5157800   +3.81
 *   2026-06-21T00:00:00Z  168.6969009   +2.80
 *   2026-09-23T00:05:00Z  315.7193686   +1.11
 *   2026-12-21T20:50:00Z   58.9978538   -0.83
 *   2026-03-21T00:00:00Z   26.0443167   +3.14
 * The seventh instant, 2026-03-20T23:59:59Z, is not corroborated this way: the Horizons
 * interface snaps a sub-minute start time onto its step grid and returned the 23:59:00 row,
 * 32 arcsecond away, so no Horizons value is claimed for it. Query: CENTER='500@399',
 * QUANTITIES='31', STEP_SIZE='1 m'. Across the corroborated instants Horizons, `eraMoon98`
 * and the engine agree to within 6 arcsecond of one another, so the engine is not the outlier
 * and this column is a genuine independent check rather than a restatement of it.
