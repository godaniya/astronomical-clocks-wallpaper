# Product design

This is the intended product contract. Implementation progress and release
planning live in the [issues](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues)
and [milestones](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/milestones).

## One observing site and one instant

Prague Orloj is the visual and projection reference. A selected observing site
supplies the coordinates for astronomy and the geographic timezone for civil
time, including daylight-saving changes. Both displays use the same instant.
Changing the site updates both; changing the phone timezone does not change the
saved site or its civil clock. Before a site is selected, the civil clock uses
the phone timezone and site-dependent astronomy is hidden.

[Issue #41](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues/41)
generalizes this single-dial contract into a pluggable family of astronomical
clocks; this section describes the Prague dial until that seam lands.

Adapt the Orloj geometry to the selected site's latitude and longitude, including
southern-hemisphere and polar sites. Draw original artwork. Detailed projection
mathematics belong in the Orloj guide introduced by
[PR #30](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/pull/30).

## Location selection and offline operation

Initial setup requests current location through Android's built-in location API
and accepts approximate results. Denial, disabled location, failure, or timeout
must leave offline city selection and coordinate entry available. Manual selection
is also directly available; settings allow explicit refresh or a different site.
Persist the selection without continuous background location tracking.

Every input method must establish the site's geographic timezone. Capturing the
phone timezone alone is insufficient; use a geographic IANA timezone with its
daylight-saving rules. Manual setup and runtime calculations must work offline,
without proprietary SDKs. Bundled data and artwork require recorded provenance
and licenses.

## Display scope

Support home and lit lock screens, subject to physical-device verification.
Render only while visible and restore the current instant and saved settings
after wake or recreation. Always On Display and interactive sky exploration are
outside the first release.

## Orloj layers and display controls

v0.2 retains the civil clock, **Zodiac ring** with equinox marker, **Sun** with its
horizon/day/twilight/night plate, and **Moon** with illuminated phase. The Sun and
plate remain one toggle. No additional dial designs are introduced. Future
planet/bright-star displays (#117, linked to #41/#73) and sunrise/sunset/twilight
readouts (#118, linked to #89) require supporting user/device evidence before
implementation or visual design. The existing plate already shows the Sun's
horizon crossing; additional event text is outside this acceptance slice.

Four native sliders have persistent labels and integer percentage readouts:

| Control | Bounds | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Size | 50–115% | 100% | Outer radius relative to 0.43 × shortest usable dimension |
| Horizontal position | 0–100% | 50% | Left-to-right safe placement range |
| Vertical position | 0–100% | 50% | Top-to-bottom safe placement range |
| Brightness | 80–100% | 100% | Black overlay across the whole rendered wallpaper |

Safe placement includes the outer rim's stroke. All dial artwork shares one
translation and uniform scale. Brightness changes neither Settings nor device
screen brightness. **Reset display** restores only these four defaults, preserving
the observing site, layer choices and appearance. Display controls remain enabled
without a site, when only the civil clock renders.

The separate `dial_display` store persists explicit adjustments immediately.
Missing/malformed values default independently; numeric outliers clamp. Reads do
not repair or write preferences. Every engine owns its viewport and observes the
shared controls until destruction; changes appear on its next visible tick.
Hidden, destroyed or surface-less engines perform no rendering.

Resolve the actual Canvas size, engine display resources, reported pixel offsets
and system insets; never force a wallpaper surface size. Recompute on each visible
frame after surface/orientation changes. A viewport too small for safe geometry is
logged and skipped. API 29+ uses the engine's [display context](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/wallpaper/WallpaperService.Engine#getDisplayContext())
so preview/active displays can have different resources. Cropping/insets unreported
by a launcher cannot be inferred; physical acceptance remains required.

#5 and v0.2 remain open until the later combined physical-device pass succeeds
and the owner merges the relevant PRs. Full battery qualification and the signed
personal release remain v0.3 work; this change creates no release or tag.
