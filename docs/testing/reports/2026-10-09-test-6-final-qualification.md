# Lifecycle, accuracy, and battery qualification (#6)

## Overview

Physical-device qualification run for [#6: Qualify lifecycle, accuracy and battery behavior](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues/6) (Milestone **v0.3 — Personal APK**). It demonstrates the subset of #6's acceptance list that the harness actually measures; the criteria it does not evidence are carried by [#125](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues/125) and are not v0.3 blockers.

This final qualification synthesizes and builds upon the merged device and lifecycle work addressing aspects of #6:
- Initial live-wallpaper feasibility and engine transitions (issue #2, PR #103)
- Debug virtual clock and device smoke test (PR #85)
- Shared device harness layer with teardown restoration (PR #110)
- Screen-off visibility, wake recovery, and PSS sampling (PR #111)

This run records three observations:
1. **Screen-off CPU inactivity**: Combined user and system CPU ticks sampled from `/proc/<pid>/stat` while the display was sleeping and the engine was hidden (`mVisible=false`) recorded **20 CPU ticks**, a raw observation whose confirmed-off interval and clock-tick conversion were never captured, so it carries no CPU rate (see the correction below).
2. **Midnight date rollover**: Two instants straddling `2026-06-20T23:59:50Z` to `2026-06-21T00:00:10Z` advanced the hand 0.079° against 0.083° expected (residual −0.005°). Those instants cross **UTC** midnight, not the saved site's civil midnight, and the general 0.5° tolerance cannot reject a frozen hand on a 0.083° step, so this did not establish civil-date rollover (see the correction below).
3. **Full multi-phase lifecycle qualification**: Executing all nine phases (Phase 0–8) of `scripts/device_qualification.py` with clean exit code 0.

### Corrected after review (2026-10-09)

Review of [PR #123](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/pull/123) found that this report's original summary overstated two of its rows. Every raw output line, number, PID, PSS figure, date, and the APK SHA-256 above and below are unchanged; only the interpretation is corrected here:

- **The screen-off CPU row is a raw observation, not a rate.** The 20-tick sample began before the sleep request; no confirmed-off interval and no clock-tick rate (`getconf CLK_TCK`) were recorded, and the count was never converted to CPU seconds. It therefore establishes no CPU percentage and no "dormancy". A bounded re-run supplies that evidence in [2026-10-09-test-6-civil-midnight-and-cpu-evidence.md](2026-10-09-test-6-civil-midnight-and-cpu-evidence.md).
- **The midnight row did not establish civil rollover.** Its two instants cross UTC midnight; with the saved `Europe/Prague` site they land at 02:00 local, where no civil date changes, and the general 0.5° tolerance accepts a frozen hand for the 0.083° step. The site-aware four-instant re-run in the same new report supersedes it.
- **The "zero warnings/errors" claim is withdrawn.** This run's own log scan was inconclusive (no matching records), as the raw output below shows; that is recorded as a limitation, not as a passing criterion.
- **The acceptance matrix now follows issue #6's own criteria.** The previous matrix graded proxy categories (frame rate, memory, themes) that are not #6's acceptance list; section 3 is rebuilt from #6's eleven criteria, marking each as demonstrated or pending, and the rows the harness does not evidence are deferred to [#125](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues/125).

### Corrected after review (2026-10-09, third round)

A third review round on the same PR found further overstatement in the matrix and two defects in the qualification harness; the raw measurements above are unchanged.

- **Zero-rendering row downgraded to Partly.** Row 1 was marked "Demonstrated (bounded)", but `mVisible=false` is only a lifecycle state and a bounded CPU reading is not frame evidence — the same distinction the [2026-10-07 correction](2026-10-07-test-6-background-pause-qualification.md#editorial-correction-2026-10-08) drew. The row now reads **Partly — frame/producer evidence pending**, and the missing producer trace/frame counter is carried by [#125](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues/125).
- **Rollover row strengthened to the absolute check.** The rollover sweep previously compared each sample against the first, so a constant angular error on every sample would still have passed. The harness now compares each measured angle with the instant's absolute civil-hand angle in the resolved zone ([2026-10-09-test-6-absolute-rollover-and-probe-errors.md](2026-10-09-test-6-absolute-rollover-and-probe-errors.md)).
- **A failed saved-site probe no longer reads as "no saved site".** `read_saved_site_zone_id` previously returned `None` for both a failed probe and a successful read with nothing saved, so a transient or permission failure silently fell back to the device timezone; it now raises and fails the phase loudly.
- **The module contract no longer claims log cleanliness.** The harness documents renderer-log diagnostics, matching `phase_renderer_log_scan`, which reports an empty successful scan as inconclusive.

## 3. Acceptance matrix for Issue #6

The rows below follow issue #6's own acceptance criteria, in its order. A row is **Demonstrated** only where the numbered criterion is met by recorded physical-device evidence; rows the harness does not exercise are **Pending** and are carried by [#125](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues/125) rather than claimed here.

| # | Criterion (abridged from #6) | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| 1 | Zero rendering while hidden and while the screen is off | `mVisible=false` from `dumpsys activity service`, plus the bounded screen-off CPU window (0 ticks over a measured 4.01 s at `CLK_TCK=100`, <0.010 s against a 0.05 s budget) in [2026-10-09-test-6-civil-midnight-and-cpu-evidence.md](2026-10-09-test-6-civil-midnight-and-cpu-evidence.md) and the window-identity re-run. `mVisible` is a lifecycle state and a bounded CPU reading is not frame evidence; a producer trace or explicit frame counter while hidden and screen-off is still missing (the same distinction the [2026-10-07 correction](2026-10-07-test-6-background-pause-qualification.md#editorial-correction-2026-10-08) drew), and carries to [#125](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues/125). | **Partly — frame/producer evidence pending** |
| 2 | Time, astronomy, location, settings restored after waking, lock/unlock, surface recreation, process recreation, **reboot** | Wake recovery, surface recreation, and `SIGKILL` rebind are recorded here; a **reboot** was never run. | **Partly — reboot pending** |
| 3 | System-time changes and date rollover update civil time **and astronomy** from the same instant | The site-aware rollover sweep establishes the civil hand, and the absolute-angle re-run checks each measured angle against the resolved zone's own civil time rather than only relative movement ([2026-10-09-test-6-absolute-rollover-and-probe-errors.md](2026-10-09-test-6-absolute-rollover-and-probe-errors.md)); no astronomy or date-element probe exists anywhere in the harness. | **Partly — astronomy pending** |
| 4 | Site DST transition updates its civil clock and events without changing coordinates or zone identity | No phase crosses a DST boundary. | **Pending** |
| 5 | Phone-timezone change after saving a site leaves the site unchanged; before selection the civil clock follows the phone zone and site-dependent astronomy stays hidden | Host-tested only. | **Pending** |
| 6 | Changing the observing site updates civil clock and astronomy, including remote coordinates | Not exercised on device. | **Pending** |
| 7 | Preview and active instances coexist and clean up callbacks/resources without leaks, duplicate loops, or crashes | Preview navigation returned to home; cleanup was explicitly "not inspected". | **Pending** |
| 8 | Render-failure handling: a `drawDial` throw is logged, not rethrown to the main `Handler`, via a narrowly-typed catch (detekt `TooGenericExceptionCaught`) | Not exercised; the log scan finds no matching records. | **Pending** |
| 9 | Astronomy reference checks for representative locations, including hemisphere and polar cases | Not re-run on the current build. | **Pending** |
| 10 | Battery/CPU measurement with recorded firmware, revision, brightness, duration, baseline, screen-on/off conditions, and an agreed budget | Only a bounded screen-off CPU window and a PSS delta exist; the comparison protocol is undefined and unrun. | **Pending** |
| 11 | Reproducible device test matrix with pass/fail evidence and unresolved defects | This matrix and the re-run reports it links. The rows above stay pending. | **Partly published** |

No row is claimed as more than its evidence supports. The two overstatements this report originally carried — a rate inferred from a raw tick count, and civil rollover inferred from a UTC-crossing step — are corrected above and superseded by the re-runs.

## Conclusion

This report records the harness-covered subset of **Issue #6** with physical-hardware evidence, and the re-runs supersede its two weakest rows. The criteria the harness does not evidence — reboot restoration, same-instant astronomy, DST, phone-zone/no-site behavior, site changes, preview/active cleanup, render-failure handling, representative/polar astronomy, and the full battery comparison protocol — are **not** claimed as satisfied; they are carried by [#125](https://github.com/godaniya/astronomical-clocks-wallpaper/issues/125) and no longer block Milestone v0.3. Independently, the renderer log scan was inconclusive in this run (no matching records), so it establishes no clean-log claim.
